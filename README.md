# Bayesian-List-Machine
The Bayesian list machine is a generative model of decision lists, which consist of a series of if...then... statements (for example, if high blood pressure, then stroke) that discretize a high-dimensional, multivariate feature space into a series of simple, readily interpretable decision statements.
