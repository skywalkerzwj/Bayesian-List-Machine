# Bayesian-List-Machine
Full abstract: We aim to produce predictive models that are not only accurate, but are
also interpretable to human experts. Our models are decision lists, which consist
of a series of if ... then. . . statements (e.g., if high blood pressure, then
stroke) that discretize a high-dimensional, multivariate feature space into a
series of simple, readily interpretable decision statements. We introduce a
generative model called Bayesian Rule Lists that yields a posterior distribution
over possible decision lists. It employs a novel prior structure to encourage
sparsity. Our experiments show that Bayesian Rule Lists has predictive
accuracy on par with the current top algorithms for prediction in machine
learning. Our method is motivated by recent developments in personalized
medicine, and can be used to produce highly accurate and interpretable medical
scoring systems. We demonstrate this by producing an alternative to the
CHADS2 score, actively used in clinical practice for estimating the risk of
stroke in patients that have atrial fibrillation. Our model is as interpretable as
CHADS2, but more accurate.
